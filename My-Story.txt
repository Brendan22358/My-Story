Hello world this is my story. My name is Brendan Gallagher and I am a good computer programmer. Mr.Gold just said that if you learn git then you know everything
and I am doing pretty well! So  far computer programming hasn't been that hard and helping other people is a lot of fun. My math class is also a joke we are learning about 
fucking translations reflections and rotations, which I learned in middle school.
