Hello world this is my story. My name is Brendan Gallagher and I am a good computer programmer. Mr.Gold just said that if you learn git then you know everything
and I am doing pretty well! So  far computer programming hasn't been that hard and helping other people is a lot of fun. My math class is also a joke we are learning about 
fucking translations reflections and rotations, which I learned in middle school. The teacher is also kind of socially clueless and doesn't understand what the students are 
saying. Right now I'm in college and career planning and half the kids in this class won't go to college so lol this class is worthless for them.
